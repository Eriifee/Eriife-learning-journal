                     <p class="diary-text"> 
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects. 
                    </p>
                     <p class="diary-text">                       
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>

                     <h4 class="diary-title">How I got started</h4>
                     <p class="diary-text"> 
                      I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. 
                    </p>
                     <p class="diary-text">                                         
                      That helped me get what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
